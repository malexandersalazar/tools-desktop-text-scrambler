# Text Scrambler

![alt text](/images/cover.png "Text Scrambler")

A simple tool to scramble text in the right way. Source files are in the `src` folder.

## Installation

Just copy the `dist` folder content. Text Scrambler can be executed through `TextScrambler.exe`.

## Usage

You just have to write numbers or letters in the text box on the left. The application will take care of replacing the letters with other random letters in uppercase or lowercase as appropriate, as well as the numbers with other random ones.

The **Skip from left** option allows you to ignore a certain number of columns of characters in each line of text so that they are not transformed.

The following are examples with **Skip from left** set to 6.

| Input Text Line        | Output Text Line   |
|:-----------------|:-------------------|
| arrow-90deg-down | arrow-06fbu-mjmo         |
| grid-1x2-fill | grid-1n4-eeys         |
| telephone-inbound | telephvox-fmzplnt        |
| umbrella | umbrelju        |
